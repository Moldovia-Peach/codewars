Welcome to my Codewars repository!

This repo contains my solutions to coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). I use these exercises to practice and improve my problem-solving skills.

## repo structure

The solutions are organised by difficulty level.

Each file includes:

- **Challenge Description**: A brief description of the challenge.
- **My Solution**: My approach to solving the challenge.

### goals and purpose

My goals for this repo are to:

- Practice and improve my coding skills.
- Document my problem-solving journey.
- Track my progress and revist challenges to improve solutions over time.

#### Usage

Feel free to explore and review the code. If you have suggestions or alternative solutions, Iâ€™d love to see them!
